            <p className="card-text">On release, Nike’s advertising slogan completely summed up what these boots are all about; “the perfect strike”. The strike zone on the T90 Laser IV is referred to as the Adaptive Shield, and it is broken down into separate areas. The upper region, or the strike zone, is designed to flex naturally with the fit as you contact the ball while giving you some added oomph, while the lower region, or swerve zone, features fins that are strategically positioned and sized to allow for closer feel on the ball, while supplying added bend when you need it. </p>

            <p className="card-text">As the modern game evolves and surfaces improve, players are left with the challenge of having a collection of boots to suit all surfaces. The F50i challenged that, with adidas releasing an innovative interchangeable soleplate. In other words, at any moment you could switch the studs to suit the pitch you were playing on. Unfortunately, the boots were bulky and the time it took to change out the studs was almost not worth it.</p>

            <p className="card-text">You can’t have a top 25 list without including what were the first true personalized and complete boots released for a Nike sponsored player. At the time, Ronaldinho was playing for Barcelona and coming off back-to-back World Player of the year awards. In other words, he was the perfect marketing piece. From the fold over tongue that created a larger striking zone to the soft K-leather upper, everything was specifically molded to complement Ronaldinho’s style.</p>

            <p className="card-text">Where its predecessor, the Vapor VII, lacked an identity and left players confused, the Vapor VIII reinvented itself into a lethal attacking weapon. An all new suede microfiber upper is coupled with the first two-blade heel design seen on the market to produce a cutting edge boot. They also provide a different type of fit, with a wider forefoot that sits lower on your foot. It results in a contoured fit that is actually quite comfortable.</p>

            <p className="card-text">During the 94 World Cup final, both Romario, who led Brazil, and Italy's Paolo Maldini sported the absolutely classy Nike Tiempo Premier, giving you some idea of the calibre this boot holds. A super soft K-leather upper featured a fantastic vamp stitching pattern and a retro fold-over tongue gave them an unmistakable look. This is the boot that lays claim to the evolution of the entire Tiempo range. </p>

            <p className="card-text">Created using a new revolutionary teijin synthetic upper, the Vapor III proved to be the stepping stone for the Vapor series, allowing Nike to produce a boot with superior ball feel, control and strike in a lightweight package. Nike also introduced their new ‘Speed Last’, which was designed to contour the anatomic curves of the foot for added comfort and maximum speed advantage.</p>

First off the third edition is a wonderful boot, but it just hasn’t proven its value on the market just yet. But the second version was a boot that seemed to be ever existent on the market, with that Challenge Red colorway flashing before me each time I blink my eyes!</p>

            <p className="card-text">Nike's first pure power boot, it featured a whole ad campaign that in itself was quite historic. The design and its name are meant to give a player comfort the whole 90 minutes without losing power or accuracy, and the off-centre lacing was completely revolutionary at that point in time.</p>

            <p className="card-text">“This shoe is made for the goal-scorer: The fit is snug, but the anatomical shape of the shoe makes it a good middle-of-the road shoe that can accommodate a wider foot as well as a more narrow foot,” says Baum of Upper 90. The upper is made of the Flyknit material Nike typically uses on running shoes. “The major benefit to this is a soft, sock-like fit with almost no break-in time.</p>
